# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
While completing the match function, the most difficult was where to place the variables of pind and sind whenever the pattern and source differed from each other. I was also confused on what they would be equal to when trying to complete the matches.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
I could use the match function to check if a movie detail, such as the genre, to see if it starts with a specific pattern or word. For example, if I'm searching for all the movies that have a genre of "Action", I can use "match("Action", movie[ "genre" ])" to find them. It can be useful for finding specific types of movies from a broad movie database.
